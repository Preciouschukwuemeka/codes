  I created an array of quotes object and added five quotes to it.
  Assigned each quote object a `quote` and `source` property, and one of the quotes with a `citation` and `year` property.

  { 
    quote: "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.",
    source: "Nelson mandela",
    citation: "www.goalcast.com/2017/05/02/top-nelson-mandela-quotes-inspire-you-to-believe",
    year: "2017"

  I created a `getRandomQuote` function and a variable that stores a random number, then used the random number to `return` a random quote object from the `quotes` array.

/***
  Also here, i created a `printQuote` function,
  Called the `getRandomQuote` function and assigned it to a variable "result".

  Created a variable for a HTML string "message" and set it equal to an empty string.
  
  I concatenated into the empty string variable 'message', an HTML string, adding the quote and source section from the quotes array object with a
    provided HTML template in the instructions, and the random quote vairable.

  To test if the quote object has a year and citation property before adding it to the HTML string, a conditional statement 'if' is required.

   After the if statement test, i Set the `innerHTML` of the `quote-box` div to the HTML string.
